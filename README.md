- Goal: see track attributes and correlation with popularity
### NOTE
I was going to do more with this, but Spotify removed it's track attribute and analysis API so I can't do any meaningful descriptive stat work with this data. Tried finding a work around, but it was more effort than need be for a relatively simple research question. It's a good thing I caught that the API was depreciated before I gathered all the URIs of their tracks. It would have been interesting to do the data analysis but c'est la vie, it was good practice. On to another thing.
